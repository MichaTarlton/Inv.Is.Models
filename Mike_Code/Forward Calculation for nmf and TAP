Forward Calculation for nmf and TAP

"You can analytically solve for m and C (it is a good exercise) and you can also find the solution in many papers (including my PRE paper in 2011 (2009) with John Hertz) and then check your simulations results agains the analytical expression."

%% nMF
How, since they all are dependent on themselves?
like mi is dependent on mj, and C is dependent on mi

hmmmmm maybe do like mi = tan(h), but this only works with the disconnected matrix, dimer idk




From eq10 roudi/hertz 2013 


-(nmfC).^-1 = Jij % so no just invert this for the C. Also note this is for decoupled

Yeah just confused about how to solve with the dimer case, I think I may need to do a gradient descent or something to figure it out


Indie pair approx

Jpair Element Template: (1 + mi' + mi + chi)

Jpair = ln(((1 + mi' + mi + chi)(1 - mi' - mi + chi))./((1 - mi' + mi - chi)(1 + mi' - mi - chi)))./4


JLR = ln(1 + Cij./((1+mi).^2)))./4
