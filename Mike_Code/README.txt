This folder contains code that I have put together from scratch

To use Forward Ising implementation:
Move the following files into your current matlab folder:
- ForIs.m
- JH.m

To run, simply type 
> ForIs
Into your matlab command line.
Certain parameters can be tweaked from inside the ForIs.m script.
